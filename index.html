			<p>I'm Duncan and a northerner by birth.</p><p>I've always worked in IT, starting on the EPOS helpdesk for an electrical retailer. I jumped into development and started coding in dBaseII (for a helpdesk call logging system), then Today 4GL for a service department system, and then Progress 4GL for a POS system</p>
			<p>My career took a strange turn when I became an implementation consultant for a software company. This involved not only coding the product, but performing requirements gathering, business process analysis, implementation and training.</p>
			<p>So I'm a front-end web developer and technical business analyst with a life-long curiosity as to why things work and why they don’t. Solutions to problems aren’t always obvious, and I always try to think outside of the box. Strengths in teamwork, investigating issues, requirements gathering and stakeholder management. Accessibility is a must.</p>
